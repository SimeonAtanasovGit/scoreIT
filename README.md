Select angle and velocity of the object thrown to the target and observe the reaction. You have five tries available. For the 
second level, move the mirrors until the detector is reached and then you will be allowed to shoot to the target. Finally, for the 
third level, shoot at the starts before shooting at the target. To win the game, succeed all three levels.
